wHAT IS AN THREAD?
Thread is an independent flow of Execution

GIL{Global Interpreter Lock} - It ensures that python code will execute only one thread at any instant of time.

Types of Multi-tasking in an OS
Process based - Multiple threads running on same OS simultaneously
Thread based - Single process consisting of seperate tasks


- Mainthread creates the child thread
- At any instant only one thread can be active until unless you are using multiprocessing
- Main thread loses it control when child thread's start function is called
- Main thread regains it control when child thread's join function is executed

Advanteages of Multi-Threading
- Enhanced Performance by decreased development time
- simplified and streamlined program coding
- simulta neous and parallelized occurence of tasks
- Better use of CPU resources
